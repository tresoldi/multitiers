# multitiers

A library for multi-tiered sequence representation of linguistic data.

## TODO

- implement initialization from saved JSON
- modify MultiTiers.as_list() in order to return a matrix suitable for
  numeric analysis (or just have a different function)
- Deal with morphological markers (and others if possible, including
  syllable and lexeme)
- Think about renaming cogid, doculect, etc. to something more general
- Implement vectors of presence/absence
- Implement vectors of phonological features from CLTS
- Review automatic alignments, especially  in Latin2Spanish
- Have a CLDF reading function, aking to wordlist2mt
